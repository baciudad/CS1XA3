## Simple App: 2048

- This is a recreation of the game 2048 with some more fun colours for each of the tiles.
- The app is controlled with the UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT Arrow Keys and will keep running until the user reached 2048 or fill the board with no more possible moves, at which point the game is over.
- The game was coded entirely in JavaScript using the P5.js library for drawing to the screen.
