Contained in this repo is a version of the overnight sensation game Flappy Bird.



This game contains 3 Pages, the Main Welcome and Login Page is where the user will enter the session and pick a Username for that particular session. Once the user clicks the OK Button they will be taken to the main game screen.

The main game is coded 100% in JavaScript using the P5.js library for graphics and design. 

- Once on the Game Page the game can be controlled either by using the left mouse button or by using the space bar, the object of the game is to get as far along as possible without hitting any of the obstacles
- When the user is satisfied with their session score and wished to post it to the Leaderboard simply press the exit button which will take the user to the Exit Page where a Thank you message is displayed and the leaderboard is shown and the user experience concludes.
